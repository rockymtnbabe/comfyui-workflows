## Note
Many workflows in this repository begin with ideas, techniques, or example workflows
shared by creators I deeply respect. I study these workflows to understand how and why
they work, then adapt, extend, and modify them to suit my own creative goals and use cases.

I continually add to these credits as I learn from amazing creators who unselfishly share their expertise.
I am so thankful for how they have helped me on my journey as an AI creator.

The workflows here represent my curated and evolving implementations, shaped through
experimentation and iteration, while openly acknowledging the creators who have guided
and influenced my learning and provided rersources along the way.
